        <h4>About this blog</h4>
        <p>Hi. My name is Bjarte Botnevik and I work as a Data Engineer. On this blog I will write posts on
             hobby projects. This includes Kaggle competitions, small electronics projects and other topics that interests
             me. It is intended to be used as a blog/portfolio for my own enjoyment, but I will share the post
             in case others find it interesting.
        </p>
